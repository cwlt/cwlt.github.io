# cwlt.github.io

The purpose of this project is to provide a simple jumping-off point for a Jekyll-based github.io site.


## Prerequisites
  * git (a tutorial on installing git can be found [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git))
  * Jekyll (optional; get it [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
  * Know how to access your terminal and some basics of using it (look [here](https://www.davidbaumgold.com/tutorials/command-line/) for an intro).
  Windows users may want to look into the Git Bash emulator (more info [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git), under the heading Install Git on Windows).

  
## Fork and Deploy the Template
  * Go to [github.com](https://www.github.com) to set yourself up an account if you don't have one already.
  * Navigate to the template's GitHub page, [github.com/cwlt/cwlt.github.io](https://www.github.com/cwlt/cwlt.github.io) (you're probably already here!).
  * On the upper right side of the page, click `Fork`.
  * The template repository will be copied to your GitHub account.
  A webpage for the new repository, now under your account, should open up.
  * Click the `Settings` tab on your copy of the repository.
  * Change the repository name to `username.github.io`, replacing `username` with your username.
  * If you navigate to `https://www.username.github.io`, replacing `username` with your username, you should see a your own copy of the template site (perhaps after a few minutes).


## Customization
 * Navigate to your github.io's repository, Navigate to the template's GitHub page, `github.com/username/username.github.io`, replacing `username` with your username.
 * Use the `Clone or Download` button to clone the repository to your own computer to start customizing on it!
 * To customize the text, search the project for text that you want to replace. The text can be edited in `README.md`
 * You can share your resume by replacing `resources/resume.pdf` with your own.
 * To add a new page, you will need to create a new Markdown file with the page's content and register it with the menu bar.
 Use the about page's entry in `_data/menu.yml` and `about.md` as a guide.
 * After each change you make you will need to `git commit filename` the file that changed, replacing `filename` with the relative path to the file that changed, and `git push master origin` to deploy it online.
 * Want to change the overall look of your site?
 You can find info about customizing your Jekyll theme at [jekyllrb.com](https://www.jekyllrb.com).
 * Want to preview changes to your site before you put it online?
 If you have Jekyll installed, you can run `jekyll serve` on the terminal from the project directory.
 Then, copy and paste the server address that is reported into your browser to view a locally-hosted version of your site.
